# FCTAssignment
Welcome to single-page application, built with:
ASP.NET Core and C# for cross-platform server-side code
Angular and TypeScript for client-side code</li>
Bootstrap for layout and styling

To help you get started, I've also set up:

The <code>ClientApp</code> subdirectory is a standard Angular CLI application. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run any <code>ng</code> command (e.g., <code>ng test</code>), or use <code>npm</code> to install extra packages into it.
